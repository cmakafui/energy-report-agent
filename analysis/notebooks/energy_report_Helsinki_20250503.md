# Energy Efficiency Report

**Year:** 1980
**Type:** Residential
**Location:** Helsinki
**Date:** May 03, 2025

## Executive Summary

This report details the energy efficiency assessment of the entrance door area in a 1980 residential building in Helsinki. Thermal analysis revealed significant energy loss primarily due to severe air leakage around the door frame and a thermal bridge at the concrete lintel above the door. These issues contribute to discomfort, drafts, and increased energy consumption. High-priority recommendations include sealing air gaps and improving weatherstripping around the door, with a medium-priority recommendation to assess and improve insulation around the lintel. Implementing these measures is expected to significantly reduce heat loss, improve indoor comfort, and lead to notable energy savings, potentially improving the property's energy rating.

## Energy Rating

Based on the identified thermal anomalies indicating significant heat loss through air leakage and a thermal bridge, the current energy efficiency of the entrance door area is considered poor.

**Estimated EU Energy Rating:** G

## Main Findings

*   **Severe Air Leakage Around Door Frame:** Thermal imaging shows significantly lower temperatures around the entire perimeter of the door frame, indicating severe air infiltration/exfiltration.
*   **Thermal Bridge at Concrete Lintel:** The concrete lintel above the door appears cooler than surrounding areas, suggesting a thermal bridge causing heat loss due to insufficient insulation.

## Priority Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Seal Air Gaps Around Door Frame
*   **Description:** Apply high-quality, flexible caulk to seal small gaps between the door frame and the wall. For larger gaps (>5mm), use minimal-expanding spray foam before caulking. Ensure all cracks and openings around the frame are sealed to prevent air infiltration.
*   **Estimated Cost:** €50 - €200
*   **Estimated Savings:** Moderate (€50 - €150 annually, depending on existing leak severity and energy costs)
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Implementation Time:** Low (1-3 hours)

### Recommendation 2: Improve Door Weatherstripping
*   **Description:** Inspect the existing weatherstripping around the door slab. If it is damaged, brittle, or missing, replace it with new, high-quality weatherstripping (e.g., foam tape, V-strip, or compression-type seals) along the top, sides, and bottom of the door. A door sweep or draft stopper can also be added to the bottom.
*   **Estimated Cost:** €30 - €150
*   **Estimated Savings:** Moderate (€40 - €120 annually, depending on existing draft severity)
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Implementation Time:** Low (1-2 hours)

### Recommendation 3: Assess and Improve Lintel Insulation
*   **Description:** Investigate the area above the door, specifically around the concrete lintel, to determine the current state of insulation. If access allows and insulation is found to be missing or inadequate, adding appropriate insulation in this area can help reduce heat loss through the thermal bridge. This may require opening up the wall structure.
*   **Estimated Cost:** Moderate to High (€300 - €1500+, depending on required access and complexity of work)
*   **Estimated Savings:** Moderate to High (€60 - €200+ annually, depending on effectiveness and energy costs)
*   **Priority:** Medium
*   **Implementation Time:** Moderate (can range from a few hours to a day or more if structural work is needed)

## Potential Improvements

Addressing the identified issues, particularly the high-priority air sealing and weatherstripping, will significantly reduce energy loss through the entrance door. Improving the lintel insulation will further enhance efficiency.

*   **Current Rating:** G
*   **Potential Rating:** E to F (depending on the extent of improvements and overall building performance)

## Financial Summary

*   **Total Estimated Investment:** €380 - €1850
    *(Sum of minimum and maximum estimated costs for all recommendations)*
*   **Total Estimated Annual Savings:** €150 - €470
    *(Sum of minimum and maximum estimated annual savings for all recommendations)*

## Conclusion

The energy efficiency analysis of the entrance door area highlights significant opportunities for improvement through targeted interventions. Prioritizing air sealing and weatherstripping will yield immediate benefits in terms of comfort and energy savings with relatively low investment and implementation time. Addressing the lintel insulation will provide further long-term energy performance improvements. Implementing these recommendations is crucial for reducing heat loss, improving indoor environmental quality, and lowering energy bills, ultimately contributing to a better energy rating for the property. Further comprehensive energy audits of the entire building are recommended to identify other areas for potential energy efficiency upgrades.
